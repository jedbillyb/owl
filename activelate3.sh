# Does the active monitor vif FOLLOW when the plain vif it rides on is retuned?
#
# activelate2.sh phase F found the way out of the 5180 pin: an active monitor
# vif created alongside a plain vif that already owns the channel comes up on
# that channel, at full reception (710 frames vs 667 for plain alone).
#
# That is only half of what AirDrop needs. OWL must follow the phone's channel
# sequence, so the pair has to be retunable mid-run. Two ways that could go:
#
#   the vifs share one channel context -> retuning the plain vif moves both,
#     and OWL gets ACKs and hopping at once. AirDrop is reachable.
#   the active vif holds its own context -> it stays put while the plain vif
#     moves, so ACKs only work on the channel it happened to open on.
#
# Both frequencies are picked from a scan (the two busiest 2.4 GHz channels) so
# there is always traffic to read a radiotap frequency from, and every phase is
# verified by that frequency rather than by what `iw` claims.
#
# SAFETY: bash trap + setsid-detached watchdog.
