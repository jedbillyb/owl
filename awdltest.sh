# Can active monitor hear AWDL at all? Back-to-back plain vs active on 5180 MHz.
#
# This is THE decisive question for AirDrop on the built-in MT7921:
#
#   plain  retunes and hears well, but never ACKs -> one-way path, no transfer
#   active ACKs (so transfer is possible in principle) but is pinned to 5180 MHz
#          and loses ~81% of reception (activetest2.sh: 186 -> 35 frames)
#
# 81% loss might still be enough to hear an iPhone's AWDL action frames, or it
# might not. If active monitor cannot receive AWDL frames, it cannot sync, and
# then no amount of ACK capability helps - AirDrop is genuinely unreachable on
# this chip. If it CAN hear them, `ACTIVE=1 ./airdrop.sh` should work.
#
# Both phases run on 5180 MHz (the only frequency active monitor can reach) and
# back-to-back, so the phone's behaviour is roughly constant across them. The
# actual radiotap frequency is verified in both - the mistake that invalidated
# activetest.sh was comparing counts from different channels.
#
# THE PHONE MUST BE ADVERTISING for this to mean anything:
#   unlock it, screen on, AirDrop > "Everyone for 10 Minutes", share sheet open.
# If plain sees 0 AWDL frames the phone was silent and the run is void - it is
# reported as such rather than being read as a result.
#
# SAFETY: bash trap + setsid-detached watchdog.
