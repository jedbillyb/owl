# Patches to the gitignored `.venv-opendrop`

OpenDrop 0.13.0 is installed into `.venv-opendrop/`, which is gitignored, so
fixes to it do not survive a rebuild of the venv. Keep them here and reapply:

```sh
cd .venv-opendrop/lib/python3.14/site-packages
git apply /home/jed/owl/patches/opendrop-ios26-airdrop.patch
```

(Void has no `patch(1)` installed; `git apply` works and the patch is verified
against it.)

## opendrop-ios26-airdrop.patch

Three fixes, all needed before an iPhone on iOS 26 can complete a transfer.
Each was found by hitting it in a live run on 2026-07-31 - see FINDINGS.md §15.

1. **Chunked request bodies.** `handle_discover` and `handle_ask` read
   `int(self.headers["Content-Length"])`. iOS 26 sends both chunked with no
   Content-Length, so this raised `TypeError: int() argument must be ... not
   'NoneType'` and killed the connection before any reply was written. Adds
   `_read_request_body()`, handling both framings. `handle_upload` already
   coped with chunked; only these two paths did not.

2. **`application/x-dvzip`.** `handle_upload` accepted only
   `application/x-cpio` and answered 406 to anything else - after the user had
   already tapped send, which is what the phone reports as "Failed". iOS 26
   sends photos as dvzip. Both types are now accepted.

3. **dvzip container + buffer to disk.** libarchive does not recognise dvzip
   ("Unrecognized archive format"). The format is a run of length-prefixed
   blocks: a 4-byte big-endian header where bit 31 means the payload is STORED
   and the low 31 bits are its length; otherwise the payload is a zlib stream.
   Blocks decompress to 128 KiB each except the last. `dvzip_to_cpio()` decodes
   it into the ODC cpio inside. The body is also buffered to disk before
   extraction, so an unparseable container leaves the raw bytes on disk rather
   than a half-read socket and nothing to show for it.

Verified end to end: a 2.06 MB transfer decoded to 17 blocks consuming the file
exactly, yielding `IMG_8276.JPG`, a 4032x3024 JPEG.
